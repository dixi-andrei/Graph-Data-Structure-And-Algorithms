  Traversal technique exploring all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  Finds the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph.

- **Levenshtein Distance:**
  Calculates the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.

- **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:**
  Finds the maximum flow in a flow network.
